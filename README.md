# Game Starter
This repo serves as boilerplate code to get started making games using Node, express, the Phaser game engine, Webpack, and Babel for transpiling ES6.
## Getting Started
Simply clone the repo and run the following commands:

`npm install`

`npm start`

The Demo game should now be running on `localhost:3000`

## Demo Game
The demo game is from the [Phaser First Game Tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/index)

The <kbd>←</kbd> <kbd>↑</kbd> <kbd>→</kbd> arrow keys control the player. Collect as may stars as you can without being hit by bombs.
